# Medical-Diagnosis-using-CNN

Our approach to building the classifier is discussed in the steps: 
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on brain tumor dataset.
2. Build a CNN model 
3. Train and Evaluate our model on the dataset

The model is trained on 10 epochs (full iterations) with train_steps for training set and validation_steps for validation set in each epoch. The batch size for each epoch is taken as 8. Our model got 83% accuracy on the test set. Now letâ€™s evaluate our model using the predict() function.
